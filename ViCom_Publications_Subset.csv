Federica Amici,2018,Social inhibition and behavioural flexibility when the context changes: a comparison across six primate species,article,"The ability to inhibit previously employed strategies and flexibly adjust behavioural responses to external conditions may be critical for individual survival. However, it is unclear which factors predict their distribution across species. Here, we investigated social inhibition and behavioural flexibility in six primate species (chimpanzees, bonobos, orangutans, gorillas, capuchin monkeys and spider monkeys) differing in terms of phylogenetic relatedness, foraging ecology and social organization. Depending on the social context, individuals could maximize their food intake by inhibiting the selection of a larger food reward in one condition (i.e. inhibition), but not in others, which required them to flexibly switching strategies across conditions (i.e. behavioural flexibility). Overall, our study revealed inter-specific differences in social inhibition and behavioural flexibility, which partially reflected differences in fission-fusion dynamics. In particular, orangutans and chimpanzees showed the highest level of inhibitory skills, while gorillas and capuchin monkeys showed the lowest one. In terms of behavioural flexibility, orangutans and spider monkeys were the best performers, while bonobos and capuchin monkeys were the worst ones. These results contribute to our understanding that inhibition and behavioural flexibility may be linked in more complex ways than usually thought, although both abilities play a crucial role in efficient problem solving.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W2790575311"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Federica Amici, Josep Call, Julia Watzek, Sarah F.

Federica Amici,2022,"The social dynamics of complex gestural communication in great and lesser apes ( <i>Pan troglodytes</i> , <i>Pongo abelii, Symphalangus syndactylus</i> )",article,"Gestures play an essential role in primate communication. However, little is known about how complexity of gestural use (in terms of repertoire size, intentional use, flexibility and use of gestural sequences) relates to individual and dyadic measures of sociality and whether more complex gestural use is more effective in eliciting a response. We observed 19 captive chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes ), 16 Sumatran orangutans ( Pongo abelii ) and 18 siamangs ( Symphalangus syndactylus ) to assess the complexity and effectiveness of their gestural use. We found that, beyond interspecies variation, the number of gesture types used in a dyad was higher when individuals had stronger social bonds; the probability of accounting for others' attention increased with age, especially for visual gestures; and sequences were more likely used by younger or socially less integrated individuals. In terms of effectiveness, older individuals and those using fewer sequences were more likely to be responded to, while across dyads, the probability of obtaining a response was higher when both individuals accounted for the other's attention and when they used fewer sequences. Overall, this confirms the link between sociality and complex gestural use and suggests that more complex forms of communication, at least in terms of intentional use, may be more effective at achieving communicative goals. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Cognition, communication and social bonds in primates’.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4290616153"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Federica Amici, Katja Liebal","Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig University",Primate Behavior and Ecology,University of Leipzig
Federica Amici,2023,Innovation across 13 ungulate species: problem solvers are less integrated in the social group and less neophobic,article,"Innovation is the ability to solve new problems or find novel solutions to familiar problems, and it is known to provide animals with crucial fitness benefits. Although this ability has been extensively studied in some taxa, the factors that predict innovation within and across species are still largely unclear. In this study, we used a novel foraging task to test 111 individuals belonging to 13 ungulate species-a still understudied taxon. To solve the task, individuals had to open transparent and opaque cups with food rewards, by removing their cover. We assessed whether individual factors (neophobia, social integration, sex, age, rank) and socio-ecological factors (dietary breadth, fission-fusion dynamics, domestication, group size) predicted participation and performance in the task. Using a phylogenetic approach, we showed that success was higher for less neophobic and socially less integrated individuals. Moreover, less neophobic individuals, individuals of domesticated species and having higher fission-fusion dynamics were more likely to participate in the task. These results are in line with recent literature suggesting a central role of sociality and personality traits to successfully deal with novel challenges, and confirm ungulates as a promising taxon to test evolutionary theories with a comparative approach.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4362537521"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Álvaro L.

Federica Amici,2019,The ability to recognize dog emotions depends on the cultural milieu in which we grow up,article,"Inter-specific emotion recognition is especially adaptive when species spend a long time in close association, like dogs and humans. Here, we comprehensively studied the human ability to recognize facial expressions associated with dog emotions (hereafter, emotions). Participants were presented with pictures of dogs, humans and chimpanzees, showing angry, fearful, happy, neutral and sad emotions, and had to assess which emotion was shown, and the context in which the picture had been taken. Participants were recruited among children and adults with different levels of general experience with dogs, resulting from different personal (i.e. dog ownership) and cultural experiences (i.e. growing up or being exposed to a cultural milieu in which dogs are highly valued and integrated in human lives). Our results showed that some dog emotions such as anger and happiness are recognized from early on, independently of experience. However, the ability to recognize dog emotions is mainly acquired through experience. In adults, the probability of recognizing dog emotions was higher for participants grown up in a cultural milieu with a positive attitude toward dogs, which may result in different passive exposure, interest or inclination toward this species.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W2985626744"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Federica Amici, James O.

Federica Amici,2019,The word order of languages predicts native speakers’ working memory,article,"The relationship between language and thought is controversial. One hypothesis is that language fosters habits of processing information that are retained even in non-linguistic domains. In left-branching (LB) languages, modifiers usually precede the head, and real-time sentence comprehension may more heavily rely on retaining initial information in working memory. Here we presented a battery of working memory and short-term memory tasks to adult native speakers of four LB and four right-branching (RB) languages from Africa, Asia and Europe. In working memory tasks, LB speakers were better than RB speakers at recalling initial stimuli, but worse at recalling final stimuli. Our results show that the practice of parsing sentences in specific directions due to the syntax and word order of our native language not only predicts the way we remember words, but also other non-linguistic stimuli.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W2914890743"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Federica Amici, Alejandro Sánchez-Amaro, Carla Sebastián‐Enesco, Trix Cacchione, Matthias Allritz, Juan Salazar-Bonet, Federico Rossano","Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, ISPA - Instituto Universitário, University of California, San Diego, Florida State University, University of Bern",Neurobiology of Language and Bilingualism,University of Leipzig
Federica Amici,2022,Compositionality in Primate Gestural Communication and Multicomponent Signal Displays,article,"Compositionality is the ability to combine meaningful elements into new combinations with novel meanings, and it has long been considered one of the main hallmarks of human communication. However, very few studies have addressed the compositional aspects of communication in species other than humans, although a comparative approach is essential to understand the evolutionary origins of human compositionality. We review previous research on compositionality in the gestural communication systems of nonhuman primates, with a special focus on the multicomponent aspects of compositionality. We start by discussing the importance of a comparative approach to study the evolution of human language and then compare the current state of the art on compositionality in the vocal, facial, and gestural communication systems of primates and other species. We further discuss alternative approaches to study compositionality in primates, which may help overcome some of the current methodological limitations in this research area. In particular, we 1) highlight the importance of interdisciplinary tools that facilitate the statistical identification of multicomponent and multimodal combinations of signals, 2) discuss different approaches to infer the meaning of signal combinations, with a special focus on the use of contextual cues and meta-communication, and 3) discuss temporal and intentional aspects of compositionality in primates. Finally, we outline possible lines of research for future studies in this area (e.g., more consistent use of terms across research areas, use of different methodological tools and larger datasets, inclusion of developmental approaches), which might shed light into the evolutionary origins of one of the most crucial properties of human communication.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4288096197"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Federica Amici, Linda Oña, Katja Liebal","Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Leipzig University",Animal Vocal Communication and Behavior,University of Leipzig

Here, we combined theoretical frameworks from cross-cultural and comparative psychology, to study maternal style in 10 mother–infant pairs of German urban humans ( Homo sapiens ) and 10 mother–infant pairs of captive chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes ), during the first year of infants’ development. We conducted focal observations of different behaviours (i.e. nursing, carrying, body contact, touching, grooming, restraining, approaching, leaving, rejection, aggression, mutual gaze, object stimulation), during natural interactions. Analyses revealed a more distal maternal style in WEIRD humans than in captive chimpanzees, with different behaviours being generally more common in one of the two species throughout development. For other behaviours (i.e. nursing), developmental trajectories differed between WEIRD humans and captive chimpanzees, although differences generally decreased through infants’ development. Overall, our study confirms functional approaches as a valid tool for comparative longitudinal studies.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4390941936"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Federica Amici, Katja Liebal, Manuela Ersson-Lembeck, Manfred Holodynski","Freie Universität Berlin, Leipzig University, University of Münster",Primate Behavior and Ecology,University of Leipzig
Federica Amici,2024,Cognitive differences between two zebra species - the role of fission-fusion dynamics,preprint,"<title>Abstract</title> In animals, high fission-fusion dynamics characterize groups in which individuals frequently split into subgroups of different size and composition, and may be linked to the enhancement of cognitive skills. However, this hypothesis has rarely been tested. Here, we compared two zebra species with different levels of fission-fusion dynamics, Chapman’s zebras (<italic>Equus burchelli chapmanni</italic>) and Grévy’s zebras (<italic>Equus grevyi</italic>), to assess potential differences in their cognitive skills. We tested 8 individuals of each species in experimental tasks assessing their object permanence, short-term memory, inference and quantity discrimination skills. Our results showed that Grévy’s zebras, which are characterized by higher levels of fission-fusion dynamics, performed better than Chapman’s zebras in tasks requiring inference and quantity discrimination skills. These findings provide preliminary support to the hypothesis that high fission-fusion dynamics are linked to the enhancement of specific cognitive skills also in taxa other than primates.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4391383660"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Alina Schaffer, Álvaro L.

Federica Amici,2019,Growing into adulthood—a review on sex differences in the development of sociality across macaques,article,"Preferential affiliative relationships, or social bonds, play a crucial role in primate social life, but little is known about their development. Here, we review macaque studies investigating the social development of both sexes. Firstly, we highlight the emergence of sex differences in mother–offspring bonds, as macaque mothers form stronger bonds with daughters, while being more aggressive towards sons, possibly contributing to maintain female philopatry and/or male dispersal. Secondly, despite paternity uncertainty, we discuss studies reporting that fathers of several macaque species preferentially engage with their offspring, but less than mothers and only in periods of high infant mortality. Thirdly, we show that immature females, the philopatric sex in macaques, already form stronger bonds with close maternal kin than immature males, mirroring social patterns during adulthood. However, this bias seems not caused by kin availability, as kin availability is similar for both sexes prior to male dispersal. Moreover, immature males might preferentially affiliate with paternal kin over non-kin, possibly because of lower maternal integration in their maternal family and/or in preparation of dispersal. Fourthly, we discuss how immature females engage in grooming and proximity with female partners as they grow older, while immature males preferentially interact with adult males and peers, playing more than females from early on. Finally, we show that most developmental changes in sociality happen around 2–3 years of age, probably representing a milestone in macaque social development. We conclude that sex differences in sociality emerge early in development and increase through time, with sexes gradually growing into their adult roles.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W2910013166"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Federica Amici, Lars Kulik, Doreen Langos, Anja Widdig","Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig University",Primate Behavior and Ecology,University of Leipzig
Federica Amici,2020,"Experience has a limited effect on humans’ ability to predict the outcome of social interactions in children, dogs and macaques",article,"The ability to predict others' behaviour represents a crucial mechanism which allows individuals to react faster and more appropriately. To date, several studies have investigated humans' ability to predict conspecifics' behaviour, but little is known on our ability to predict behaviour in other species. Here, we aimed to test humans' ability to predict social behaviour in dogs, macaques and humans, and assess the role played by experience and evolution on the emergence of this ability. For this purpose, we presented participants with short videoclips of real-life social interactions in dog, child and macaque dyads, and then asked them to predict the outcome of the observed interactions (i.e. aggressive, neutral or playful). Participants were selected according to their previous species-specific experience with dogs, children and non-human primates. Our results showed a limited effect of experience on the ability to predict the outcome of social interactions, which was mainly restricted to macaques. Moreover, we found no support to the co-domestication hypothesis, in that participants were not especially skilled at predicting dog behaviour. Finally, aggressive outcomes in dogs were predicted significantly worse than playful or neutral ones. Based on our findings, we suggest possible lines for future research, like the inclusion of other primate species and the assessment of cultural factors on the ability to predict behaviour across species.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W3108823513"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Sasha Donnier, Gyula Kovács, Linda Oña, Juliane Bräuer, Federica Amici","University of Girona, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Friedrich Schiller University Jena",Human-Animal Interaction Studies,University of Leipzig
Federica Amici,2021,Neophobia in 10 ungulate species—a comparative approach,article,"Neophobia (the fearful reaction to novel stimuli or situations) has a crucial effect on individual fitness and can vary within and across species. However, the factors predicting this variation are still unclear. In this study, we assessed whether individual characteristics (rank, social integration, sex) and species socio-ecological characteristics (dietary breadth, group size, domestication) predicted variation in neophobia. For this purpose, we conducted behavioral observations and experimental tests on 78 captive individuals belonging to 10 different ungulate species-an ideal taxon to study inter-specific variation in neophobia given their variety in socio-ecological characteristics. Individuals were tested in their social groups by providing them with familiar food, half of which had been positioned close to a novel object. We monitored the individual latency to approach and eat food and the proportion of time spent in its proximity. Using a phylogenetic approach and social network analyses, we showed that across ungulate species neophobia was higher in socially more integrated individuals, as compared to less integrated ones. In contrast, rank and sex did not predict inter-individual differences in neophobia. Moreover, species differed in their levels of neophobia, with Barbary sheep being on average less neophobic than all the other study species. As group size in Barbary sheep was larger than in all the other study species, these results support the hypothesis that larger group size predicts lower levels of neophobia, and confirm ungulates as a highly promising taxon to study animal behavior and cognition with a comparative perspective.In several species, individuals may respond fearfully to novel stimuli, therefore reducing the risks they may face. However, it is yet unclear if certain individuals or species respond more fearfully to novelty. Here, we provided food to 78 individual ungulates with different characteristics (e.g., sex, rank, social integration, group size, domestication, dietary breadth) in different controlled conditions (e.g., when food was close to novel or to familiar objects). Across species, we found that socially integrated individuals responded more fearfully in all species. Moreover, being in larger groups decreased the probability of fearfully responding to novelty.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00265-021-03041-0.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W3174105255"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Alina Schaffer, Álvaro L.

Among non-human primates, however, there is no evidence of behavioural contagion in Platyrrhines (i.e. primates from South and Central America) yet. Here, we investigated whether behavioural contagion is also present in this taxon, by assessing yawning and scratching contagion in a wild group (N = 49) of Geoffroy’s spider monkeys ( Ateles geoffroyi ). We conducted focal samples to examine whether individuals observing the triggering event (i.e. a naturally occurring yawning or scratching event in the group) would be more likely to yawn or scratch in the following 3 min, as compared to individuals who did not observe the triggering event. We ran generalized linear mixed models using a Bayesian approach, and found that the probability of yawning and scratching was higher for individuals observing others yawning and scratching, respectively, as compared to individuals who did not observe such an event. Behavioural contagion did not vary depending on the observer’s sex, kinship or relationship quality with the individual performing the triggering event. These findings provide the first evidence for yawning and scratching contagion in a wild group of spider monkeys, and importantly contribute to the debate about the evolutionary origins of behavioural contagion in primates.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4378172550"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Sara Valdivieso‐Cortadella, Chiara Bernardi‐Gómez, Filippo Aureli, Miquel Llorente, Federica Amici","University of Girona, Universidad Veracruzana, Leipzig University",Primate Behavior and Ecology,University of Leipzig

As such, it may be highly adaptive in a variety of socio-ecological contexts, and thus be widespread across animal taxa. To date, gaze following has been mostly studied in primates, and partially in birds, but little is known on the gaze following abilities of other taxa and, especially, on the evolutionary pressures that led to their emergence. In this study, we used an experimental approach to test gaze following skills in a still understudied taxon, ungulates. Across four species (i.e., domestic goats and lamas, and non-domestic guanacos and mouflons), we assessed the individual ability to spontaneously follow the gaze of both conspecifics and human experimenters in different conditions. In line with our predictions, species followed the model’s gaze both with human and conspecific models, but more likely with the latter. Except for guanacos, all species showed gaze following significantly more in the experimental conditions (than in the control ones). Despite the relative low number of study subjects, our study provides the first experimental evidence of gaze following skills in non-domesticated ungulates, and contributes to understanding how gaze following skills are distributed in another taxon—an essential endeavor to identify the evolutionary pressures leading to the emergence of gaze following skills across taxa.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W3104880496"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Alina Schaffer, Álvaro L.

Federica Amici,2020,Dominance style only partially predicts differences in neophobia and social tolerance over food in four macaque species,article,"Primates live in complex social systems with social structures ranging from more to less despotic. In less despotic species, dominance might impose fewer constraints on social choices, tolerance is greater than in despotic species and subordinates may have little need to include novel food items in the diet (i.e. neophilia), as contest food competition is lower and resources more equally distributed across group members. Here, we used macaques as a model to assess whether different dominance styles predict differences in neophilia and social tolerance over food. We provided familiar and novel food to 4 groups of wild macaques (N = 131) with different dominance styles ( Macaca fuscata , M. fascicularis , M. sylvanus , M. maura ). Our study revealed inter- and intra-specific differences in individuals’ access to food, which only partially reflected the dominance styles of the study subjects. Contrary to our prediction, social tolerance over food was higher in more despotic species than in less despotic species. Individuals with a higher dominance rank and being better socially integrated (i.e. higher Eigenvector centrality) were more likely to retrieve food in all species, regardless of their dominance style. Partially in line with our predictions, less integrated individuals more likely overcame neophobia (as compared to more integrated ones), but only in species with more tolerance over food. Our study suggests that individual characteristics (e.g. social integration or personality) other than dominance rank may have a stronger effect on an individual’s access to resources.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W3110696620"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Federica Amici, Anja Widdig, Andrew J.

Federica Amici,2022,The Habituation Process in Two Groups of Wild Moor Macaques (Macaca maura),article,"When studying animal behavior in the wild, some behaviors may require observation from a relatively short distance. In these cases, habituation is commonly used to ensure that animals do not perceive researchers as a direct threat and do not alter their behavior in their presence. However, habituation can have significant effects on the welfare and conservation of the animals. Studying how nonhuman primates react to the process of habituation can help to identify the factors that affect habituation and implement habituation protocols that allow other researchers to speed up the process while maintaining high standards of health and safety for both animals and researchers. In this study, we systematically described the habituation of two groups of wild moor macaques (Macaca maura), an Endangered endemic species of Sulawesi Island (Indonesia), to assess the factors that facilitate habituation and reduce impact on animal behavior during this process. During 7 months, we conducted behavioral observations for more than 7,872 encounters and an average of 120 days to monitor how macaque behavior toward researchers changed through time in the two groups under different conditions. We found that both study groups (N = 56, N = 41) became more tolerant to the presence of researchers during the course of the habituation, with occurrence of neutral group responses increasing, and minimum distance to researchers and occurrence of fearful group responses decreasing through time. These changes in behavior were predominant when macaques were in trees, with better visibility conditions, when researchers maintained a longer minimum distance to macaques and, unexpectedly, by the presence of more than one researcher. By identifying these factors, we contribute to designing habituation protocols that decrease the likelihood of fearful responses and might reduce the stress experienced during this process.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4205893101"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Clara Hernández Tienda, Bonaventura Majolo, Teresa Romero, Risma Illa Maulany, Putu Oka Ngakan, Víctor Beltrán Francés, Elisa Gregorio Hernández, José Gómez-Melara, Miquel Llorente, Federica Amici","University of Girona, Hasanuddin University, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Universidad de Sevilla, University of Lincoln",Primate Behavior and Ecology,University of Leipzig
Federica Amici,2022,"Maternal stress, child behavior and the promotive role of older siblings",article,"Background In the first years of their lives, children develop the cognitive, social and emotional skills that will provide the foundations for their lifelong health and achievements. To increase their life prospects and reduce the long-term effects of early aversive conditions, it is therefore crucial to understand the risk factors that negatively affect child development and the factors that are instead beneficial. In this study, we tested (i) the effects of different social and environmental stressors on maternal stress levels, (ii) the dynamic relationship between maternal stress and child behavior problems during development, and (iii) the potential promotive (i.e. main) or protective (i.e. buffering) effect of siblings on child behavior problems during development. Methods We used longitudinal data from 373 mother–child pairs (188 daughters, 185 sons) from pregnancy until 10 years of age. We assessed maternal stress and child behavior problems (internalizing and externalizing) with validated questionnaires, and then used linear mixed models, generalized linear mixed models and longitudinal cross-lagged models to analyze the data. Results Our results showed that higher maternal stress levels were predicted by socio-environmental stressors (i.e. the lack of sufficient social areas in the neighborhood). Moreover, prenatal maternal stress reliably predicted the occurrence of behavior problems during childhood. Finally, the presence of older siblings had a promotive function, by reducing the likelihood that children developed externalizing problems. Conclusions Overall, our results confirm the negative effects that maternal stress during pregnancy may have on the offspring, and suggest an important main effect of older siblings in promoting a positive child development.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4225147737"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Federica Amici, Stefan Röder, Wieland Kieß, Michael Borte, Ana Claudia Zenclussen, Anja Widdig, Gunda Herberth","Klinikum St. Georg, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig University, Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research",Maternal Mental Health During Pregnancy and Postpartum,University of Leipzig
Federica Amici,2023,Face to face interactions in chimpanzee ( <i>Pan troglodytes</i> ) and human ( <i>Homo sapiens</i> ) mother–infant dyads,article,"Human mothers interact with their infants in different ways. In Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic (WEIRD) societies, face-to-face interactions and mutual gazes are especially frequent, yet little is known about their developmental trajectories and if they differ from those of other primates. Using a cross-species developmental approach, we compared mother–infant interactions in 10 dyads of urban humans from a WEIRD society ( Homo sapiens ) and 10 dyads of captive zoo-based chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes ), when infants were one, six and 12 months old. Results showed that face-to-face interactions with mutual gaze events were common in both groups throughout the infant's first year of life. The developmental trajectories of maternal and infants’ looks partially differed between species, but mutual gaze events were overall longer in humans than in chimpanzees. Mutual gazes were also more frequent in humans, peaking at six months in humans, while increasing with age in chimpanzees. The duration and frequency of mutual gazes varied across contexts in both groups, with mutual gazes being longer during caring/grooming and feeding contexts. These findings confirm that some aspects of early socio-cognitive development are shared by humans and other primates, and highlight the importance of combining developmental and cross-species approaches to better understand the evolutionary roots of parenting behaviour.

Here we tested if giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis), despite having a smaller relative brain size, can rely on relative frequencies to predict sampling outcomes. We presented them with two transparent containers filled with different quantities of highly-liked food and less-preferred food. The experimenter covertly drew one piece of food from each container, and let the giraffe choose between the two options. In the first task, we varied the quantity and relative frequency of highly-liked and less-preferred food pieces. In the second task, we inserted a physical barrier in both containers, so giraffes only had to take into account the upper part of the container when predicting the outcome. In both tasks giraffes successfully selected the container more likely to provide the highly-liked food, integrating physical information to correctly predict sampling information. By ruling out alternative explanations based on simpler quantity heuristics and learning processes, we showed that giraffes can make decisions based on statistical inferences.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4372335605"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Álvaro L.

Federica Amici,2021,Dominance style predicts differences in food retrieval strategies,article,"In several species, rank predicts access to food, and subordinates may need specific behavioural strategies to get a share of resources. This may be especially important in despotic species, where resources are strongly biased in favour of dominants and subordinates may more strongly rely on specific tactics to maximize food intake. Here, we compared three macaque species with an experimental set-up reproducing feeding competition contest. Following our predictions, more tolerant species mostly retrieved food in the presence of others and were less dependent on specific tactics. Contrarily, subordinates in more despotic species more likely collected food (1) when dominants could not see food or (2) were attacking others, (3) while ""dissimulating"", or (4) ""storing food"". Our study reveals that dominance styles reliably predict the probability of using specific food retrieval tactics and provides important insights on the social conditions that might have led to the emergence of tactical deception.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W3128083243"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","José Gómez-Melara, Rufino Acosta Naranjo, Alba Castellano‐Navarro, Víctor Beltrán Francés, Álvaro L.

Federica Amici,2022,Understanding potential conflicts between human and non-human-primates: a large-scale survey in Malaysia,article,"With increasing anthropogenic pressure, interactions between humans and wildlife may become more frequent, including conflictual ones. To reduce conflicts, it is important to understand how different factors (e.g. education, previous experience, demographic variables) interplay with each other and contribute to the emergence of negative attitudes and behaviours toward wildlife in humans. To address this issue, we conducted a large-scale questionnaire in Malaysia, focusing on potential conflicts between human and other primates. We used generalized linear mixed models to assess how formal education, knowledge about primates, negative experience and potential competition affected participants’ negative attitudes to primates (i.e. how humans perceive primates), their behavioural intentions (i.e. opinion on how to reduce conflicts) and behaviour (i.e. measures taken to reduce negative interactions). We found that negative experience and potential competition had a negative impact on participants’ attitude and behavior (i.e. primates were more likely perceived as filthy, as negatively affecting residents’ health and safety, and as an increasing problem, with participants more likely to use invasive methods, including captures). Both higher education and better knowledge of primates predicted more positive behavioural intentions (i.e. primates should be protected, non-invasive interventions should be used). Higher education, however, was also linked to more negative attitudes (i.e. primates negatively affect residents’ health and safety), and partly to negative behavior (e.g. use of invasive methods). In contrast, better knowledge about primates predicted positive behaviour (i.e. exclusive use of non-invasive methods). Therefore, although better knowledge of primates had no clear effect on human attitudes, it may impact on their decisions to reduce potential conflicts with wildlife, and might be the most powerful tool to mitigate conflicts between humans and other species.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4214741524"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Karimullah Karimullah, Anja Widdig, Shahrul Anuar Mohd Sah, Federica Amici","Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Universiti Sains Malaysia, German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research, Leipzig University",Primate Behavior and Ecology,University of Leipzig

Federica Amici,2020,Play behavior in immature moor macaques (<i>Macaca maura</i>) and Japanese macaques (<i>Macaca fuscata</i>),article,"Play is widespread across mammalian taxa, but species strongly vary in the ways they play. In less despotic primate species (i.e., with less steep dominance hierarchies, less severe conflicts, and more reconciliation), play has been described as being more frequent, cooperative, and freely expressed. To study the link between social play and dominance style, we compared play behavior in free‐ranging infants, juveniles and subadults of more despotic Japanese macaques ( Macaca fuscata, N = 24) and less despotic moor macaques ( Macaca maura, N = 17). We found interspecific differences in play behavior that corresponded with the contrasting dominance styles of the study species, largely confirming our predictions. In particular, moor macaques spent a larger proportion of time in solitary and social play than Japanese macaques, while Japanese macaques spent a larger proportion of time in grooming interactions. In moor macaques, play sessions included more players, a larger variety of play behaviors, greater play face rates, a greater proportion of time in contact play, and a higher rate of reciprocal play‐biting than in Japanese macaques. Aggressive escalations were not common, but more frequent in Japanese macaques. Finally, a higher frequency of play faces during play sessions predicted the occurrence of more reciprocal play‐bites, but not the proportion of time spent in contact play behaviors. Additional studies on other groups and species will allow a better understanding of the link between dominance style and social play.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W3080548415"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Víctor Beltrán Francés, Alba Castellano‐Navarro, Risma Illa Maulany, Putu Oka Ngakan, Andrew J.

Federica Amici,2018,"Assessment of Male Reproductive Skew via Highly Polymorphic STR Markers in Wild Vervet Monkeys, Chlorocebus pygerythrus",article,"Male reproductive strategies have been well studied in primate species where the ability of males to monopolize reproductive access is high. Less is known about species where males cannot monopolize mating access. Vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) are interesting in this regard as female codominance reduces the potential for male monopolization. Under this condition, we assessed whether male dominance rank still influences male mating and reproductive success, by assigning paternities to infants in a population of wild vervets in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. To determine paternity, we established microsatellite markers from noninvasive fecal samples via cross-species amplification. In addition, we evaluated male mating and reproductive success for 3 groups over 4 mating seasons. We identified 21 highly polymorphic microsatellites (number of alleles = 7.5 ± 3.1 [mean ± SD], observed heterozygosity = 0.691 ± 0.138 [mean ± SD]) and assigned paternity to 94 of 97 sampled infants (96.9%) with high confidence. Matings pooled over 4 seasons were significantly skewed across 3 groups, although skew indices were low (B index = 0.023-0.030) and mating success did not correlate with male dominance. Paternities pooled over 4 seasons were not consistently significantly skewed (B index = 0.005-0.062), with high-ranking males siring more offspring than subordinates only in some seasons. We detected 6 cases of extra-group paternity (6.4%) and 4 cases of natal breeding (4.3%). Our results suggest that alternative reproductive strategies besides priority of access for dominant males are likely to affect paternity success, warranting further investigation into the determinants of paternity among species with limited male monopolization potential.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W2890189143"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Mirjam M I Minkner, Christopher Young, Federica Amici, Richard McFarland, Louise Barrett, J.

Federica Amici,2018,Object permanence in Giraffa camelopardalis: First steps in giraffes’ physical cognition.,article,"lthough behavior, biology, and ecology of giraffes have been widely studied, little is known about their cognition. Giraffes' feeding ecology and their fission-fusion social dynamics are comparable with those of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), suggesting that they might have complex cognitive abilities. To assess this, we tested 6 captive giraffes on their object permanence, short-term memory, and ability to use acoustic cues to locate food. First, we tested whether giraffes understand that objects continue to exist even when they are out of sight. Giraffes saw one of two opaque containers containing food, then containers were closed, and 2 s later giraffes could choose one. Second, we measured giraffes' memory repeating the procedure but with a delay of 30 s, 60 s, or 2 min between closing the containers and subjects' choice. Finally, we investigated whether giraffes could locate food inside one of two identical opaque containers, when the only cue provided was the sound made by food when shaking the baited container, or the lack of sound when shaking the empty container. Our results show that giraffes form mental representations of completely hidden objects, but may not store them for longer than 30 s. Moreover, they rely on stimulus enhancement rather than acoustic cues to locate food, when no visual cues are provided. Finally, we argue that giraffes and other ungulates might be a suitable model to investigate the evolution of complex cognitive abilities from a comparative perspective.

Federica Amici,2021,Artificial Termite-Fishing Tasks as Enrichment for Sanctuary-Housed Chimpanzees: Behavioral Effects and Impact on Welfare,article,"ificial termite-fishing tasks are a common enrichment for captive great apes, promoting species-typical behaviors. Nonetheless, whether these activities are linked to changes in other behaviors and whether these changes persist over time has seldom been investigated. We assessed whether the use of an artificial termite-fishing task was linked to changes in the solitary behavior and social dynamics in two groups of sanctuary-housed chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). Specifically, we compared chimpanzee behavior during eight enrichment sessions distributed over a two-month period, with similar periods before and after the introduction of the enrichment. Data were collected from combined interval and continuous sampling methods and were analyzed using generalized linear mixed models. We found that participation increased across sessions and that both enrichment and participation predicted an increase in tool use and feeding and a decrease in inactivity, which were all maintained throughout the sessions. Furthermore, participation was positively associated with social proximity, revealing a gathering effect of the task. However, neither enrichment nor participation were linked to changes in abnormal, self-directed, affiliation-related or aggression-related behaviors. Overall, our results support the hypothesis that artificial termite-fishing is a suitable enrichment for captive chimpanzees, maintaining the subjects' interest and promoting species-typical behaviors, with no negative effects on social activities.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W3206459413"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Maria Padrell, Federica Amici, Maria Pau Córdoba, Albert Giberga, Antonio Broekman, Susana Almagro, Miquel Llorente","University of Girona, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Fundación Atapuerca, Leipzig University",Primate Behavior and Ecology,University of Leipzig
Federica Amici,2020,"Personality, cognition and behavior in chimpanzees: a new approach based on Eysenck’s model",article,"Personality has been linked to individual variation in interest and performance in cognitive tasks. Nevertheless, this relationship is still poorly understood and has rarely been considered in animal cognition research. Here, we investigated the association between personality and interest, motivation and task performance in 13 sanctuary chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) housed at Fundació Mona (Spain). Personality was assessed with a 12-item questionnaire based on Eysenck's Psychoticism-Extraversion-Neuroticism model completed by familiar keepers and researchers. Additionally, personality ratings were compared to behavioral observations conducted over an 11-year period. Experimental tasks consisted in several puzzle boxes that needed to be manipulated in order to obtain a food reward. Dependent variables included participation (as an indicator of interest), success and latency (as measures of performance), and losing contact with the task (as an indicator of motivation). As predicted, we obtained significant correlations between Eysenck's personality traits and observed behaviors, although some expected associations were absent. We then analyzed data using Generalized Linear Mixed Models, running a model for each dependent variable. In both sexes, lower Extraversion and lower Dominance were linked to a higher probability of success, but this effect was stronger in females. Furthermore, higher Neuropsychoticism predicted higher probability of success in females, but not in males. The probability of losing contact with the task was higher in young chimpanzees, and in those rated lower on Extraversion and higher on Dominance. Additionally, chimpanzees rated higher on Neuropsychoticism were also more likely to stop interacting with the task, but again this was more evident in females. Participation and latency were not linked to any personality trait. Our findings show that the PEN may be a good model to describe chimpanzee personality, and stress the importance of considering personality when interpreting the results of cognitive research in non-human primates.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W3049640954"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Maria Padrell, David Riba, Yulán Úbeda, Federica Amici, Miquel Llorente","University of Girona, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology",Primate Behavior and Ecology,University of Leipzig

Yet, very few studies have documented encounters between primates and snakes in the wild. Here, we provide a preliminary account of how wild moor macaques ( Macaca maura ) respond to seven species of real and model snakes. Snakes could be local and dangerous to the macaques (i.e., venomous or constricting), local and nondangerous, and novel and dangerous. Macaques reacted most strongly to constrictors (i.e., pythons), exploring them and producing alarm calls, and partially to vipers (both local and novel), exploring them but producing no alarm calls. However, they did not react to other dangerous (i.e., king cobra) or nondangerous species. Our results suggest that moor macaques discriminate local dangerous snakes from nondangerous ones, and may use specific cues (e.g., triangular head shape) to generalize their previous experience with vipers to novel species.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W3179302407"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Clara Hernández Tienda, Víctor Beltrán Francés, Bonaventura Majolo, Teresa Romero, Risma Illa Maulany, Putu Oka Ngakan, Federica Amici","University of Girona, Hasanuddin University, University of Lincoln, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology",Animal Vocal Communication and Behavior,University of Leipzig

We assessed the behavioral effects of a novel tool-based enrichment on 14 chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) housed at Fundació Mona (Girona, Spain). The device consisted of a vertical maze filled with food rewards, which chimpanzees could extract by using tools. We conducted behavioral observations in two conditions over an approximately 2.5-month period: when the food maze was loaded (12 enrichment days), and when it was empty (12 baseline days). Data were collected using 2-min scan sampling and untimed-event focal sampling during two daily sessions of 80 min each. We expected that the chimpanzees' interest in the enrichment would decrease over time, but that its use would be linked to an increase in the occurrence of species-typical behaviors, a reduction in negative indicators of welfare, and changes in social behaviors. We found that participation widely varied among subjects, being higher in females and decreasing through time. Furthermore, participation was linked to an increase in tool use and a decrease in inactivity, but also to an increase in aggression-related behaviors. In contrast, participation had no effect on the occurrence of abnormal behaviors, social proximity or affiliation-related behaviors. Finally, we detected an increase in self-directed behaviors only when subjects actively interacted with the device. We conclude that, in future studies, these types of devices should be evaluated for longer periods of time and more attention should be paid to individuals' preferences and abilities.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4285726354"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Maria Padrell, Federica Amici, Maria Pau Córdoba, Miquel Llorente","University of Girona, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology",Primate Behavior and Ecology,University of Leipzig

Wolves are said to engage in cooperative hunting regularly, whereas dogs could have maintained, improved, or reduced their cooperative skills during the domestication process. We compared the performance of individuals from two wolf packs and two dog groups with similar gender and rank structure. Members of these groups were tested in dyads with a problem-solving paradigm that involved aspects of a hunting-like situation. Subjects needed to coordinate their actions in order to get food. They were confronted with a social dilemma, in which an individual benefit from being selfish, unless the partner also chooses the selfish alternative, in which case the whole dyad loses. In the task, one partner was required to draw a barrier toward it by rushing forward, allowing the other partner to access the food, at which point both partners were allowed to access the food. Most dyads could solve the problem, with significant variation in their performance but no differences between species. However, the probability of taking the risk in a dyad depended on the species and rank of the individual and on cofeeding in the dyad. The results of this study show that wolves do not always outperform dogs when coordinating their actions, but that the cooperative behavior of Canis depends on many factors, including rank, type of task, and tolerance within the dyad.

We observed a wild group of 52 spider monkeys, and assessed the distribution of visual and tactile gestures in the group, the size of individual repertoires, and the intentionality and effectiveness of individuals’ gestural production. Our results showed that younger spider monkeys were more likely than older ones to use tactile gestures, despite no inter-individual differences in the distribution of visual gestures. Repertoire size did not vary with age, whereas the probability of accounting for recipients’ attentional state was higher for older monkeys than for younger ones, especially for gestures in the visual modality. Using vocalizations right before the gesture increased the probability of gesturing toward attentive recipients and of receiving a response, although age had no effect on the probability of gestures being responded. Overall, our study provides first evidence of complex gestural communication in a Platyrrhine species, and confirms this taxon as a valid candidate for research on animal communication.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4321370262"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Felipe Villa Larenas, Miquel Llorente, Katja Liebal, Federica Amici","University of Girona, Leipzig University",Primate Behavior and Ecology,University of Leipzig

In Task 2, we tested whether great apes can differentiate between similar events having happened at different times in the past. Finally, in Task 3, we tested whether great apes can use their memory flexibly, incorporating novel information in their memories. In none of the tasks did our subjects make the correct choice significantly above chance, with performance further declining when subjects were presented with 2 events (Task 2). Moreover, none of them could reliably integrate novel information into their memories.

In line with research on human development and building on previous research adopting a gradualist framework, we categorized the initial mirror responses of naive spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi) according to four levels. We compared social, exploratory, contingent and self-exploratory responses to a mirror and faux mirror during three short trials. If spider monkeys respond as most monkey species, we predicted they would perform at level 0, mainly showing social behavior toward their mirror-image. However, because spider monkeys show enhancement of certain cognitive skills comparable to those of great ape species, we predicted that they would perform at level 1a (showing exploratory behavior) or 1b (showing contingent behavior). GLMMs revealed that monkeys looked behind and visually inspected the mirror significantly more in the mirror than the faux mirror condition. Although the monkeys engaged in contingent body movements at the mirror, this trend was not significant. Strikingly, they showed no social behaviors toward their mirror-image. We also measured self-scratching as an indicator of anxiety and found no differences in frequencies of self-scratching between conditions. Therefore, in contrast to most findings on other species, spider monkeys did not treat their image as another monkey during their initial exposure to the mirror. In fact, they reached at least level 1a within minutes of mirror exposure. These responses recommend spider monkeys as good candidates for further explorations into monkey self-recognition.

Federica Amici,2021,"Comparative cognition in three understudied ungulate species: European bison, forest buffalos and giraffes",article,"Background Comparative cognition has historically focused on a few taxa such as primates, birds or rodents. However, a broader perspective is essential to understand how different selective pressures affect cognition in different taxa, as more recently shown in several studies. Here we present the same battery of cognitive tasks to two understudied ungulate species with different socio-ecological characteristics, European bison ( Bison bonasus ) and forest buffalos ( Syncerus caffer nanus ), and we compare their performance to previous findings in giraffes ( Giraffa camelopardalis ). We presented subjects with an Object permanence task, Memory tasks with 30 and 60 s delays, two inference tasks based on acoustic cues (i.e. Acoustic inference tasks) and a control task to check for the use of olfactory cues (i.e. Olfactory task). Results Overall, giraffes outperformed bison and buffalos, and bison outperformed buffalos (that performed at chance level). All species performed better in the Object permanence task than in the Memory tasks and one of the Acoustic inference tasks (which they likely solved by relying on stimulus enhancement). Giraffes performed better than buffalos in the Shake full Acoustic inference task, but worse than bison and buffalos in the Shake empty Acoustic inference task. Conclusions In sum, our results are in line with the hypothesis that specific socio-ecological characteristics played a crucial role in the evolution of cognition, and that higher fission-fusion levels and larger dietary breadth are linked to higher cognitive skills. This study shows that ungulates may be an excellent model to test evolutionary hypotheses on the emergence of cognition.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W3176928289"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Álvaro L.

Sequences often continued even after triggering the recipient’s response and were mostly produced by males and younger individuals, toward younger recipients. Only three sequences (i.e., embrace-pectoral sniff, push-present climb, grab-grab pull) occurred more than twice and were not mere repetitions of the same gesture type. Our results suggest that sequences are common in the gestural communication of spider monkeys and that they are likely the result of increased emotional arousal, rather than an attempt to convey novel meaning.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4392230919"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Eva Corral, Sara Cardoso Rodriguez, Katja Liebal, Miquel Llorente, Federica Amici","University of Girona, Leipzig University",Primate Behavior and Ecology,University of Leipzig
Federica Amici,2024,A first exploratory comparison of the behaviour of wolves (Canis lupus) and wolf-dog hybrids in captivity,article,"Extensive introgression of genes from domesticated taxa may be a serious threat for the genomic integrity and adaptability of wild populations. Grey wolves ( Canis lupus ) are especially vulnerable to this phenomenon, but there are no studies yet assessing the potential behavioural effects of dog-introgression in wolves. In this study, we conducted a first systematic comparison of admixed (N = 11) and non-admixed (N = 14) wolves in captivity, focusing on their reaction to unfamiliar humans and novel objects, and the cohesiveness of their social groups. When exposed to unfamiliar humans in the experimental task, wolves were more vigilant, fearful and aggressive than admixed wolves, and less likely to approach humans, but also more likely to spend time in human proximity. When exposed to novel objects, wolves were more aggressive than admixed wolves, less likely to spend time in object proximity, and more likely to interact with objects, but also less vigilant and as fearful as admixed wolves. Finally, social networks were more cohesive in wolves than in admixed wolves. Although caution is needed when comparing groups of captive individuals with different life experiences, our study suggests that dog admixture may lead to important behavioural changes in wolves, with possible implications for conservation strategies.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4392344656"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Federica Amici, Simone Meacci, Emmeline Caray, Linda Oña, Katja Liebal, Paolo Ciucci","Université de Strasbourg, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig University, Sapienza University of Rome",Human-Animal Interaction Studies,University of Leipzig
Federica Amici,2024,Gestural communication in wild spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi),article,"Gestures play a central role in the communication systems of several animal families, including primates. In this study, we provide a first assessment of the gestural systems of a Platyrrhine species, Geoffroy’s spider monkeys ( Ateles geoffroyi ). We observed a wild group of 52 spider monkeys and assessed the distribution of visual and tactile gestures in the group, the size of individual repertoires and the intentionality and effectiveness of individuals’ gestural production. Our results showed that younger spider monkeys were more likely than older ones to use tactile gestures. In contrast, we found no inter-individual differences in the probability of producing visual gestures. Repertoire size did not vary with age, but the probability of accounting for recipients’ attentional state was higher for older monkeys than for younger ones, especially for gestures in the visual modality. Using vocalizations right before the gesture increased the probability of gesturing towards attentive recipients and of receiving a response, although age had no effect on the probability of gestures being responded. Overall, our study provides first evidence of gestural production in a Platyrrhine species, and confirms this taxon as a valid candidate for research on animal communication.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4392346509"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Felipe Villa-Larenas, Miquel Llorente, Katja Liebal, Federica Amici","University of Girona, Leipzig University",Primate Behavior and Ecology,University of Leipzig

To assess inter-specific variation in cognitive skills, we used ungulates as a study model, testing a total of 26 captive individuals across 5 different species (i.e., dwarf goats, Capra aegagrus hircus , llamas, Lama glama , guanacos, Lama guanicoe , zebras, Equus grevyi , and rhinos, Diceros bicornis michaeli ). Across species, we used the same well-established experimental procedures to test individuals’ object permanence, short-term memory, causality, understanding of object properties, and gravity. Our results revealed that study subjects showed object permanence, were able to remember the position of hidden food after up to 60 seconds, and inferred the position of hidden food from the sound produced or not produced when shaking containers. Moreover, they showed an understanding of basic object properties, being able to locate objects hidden behind occluders based on their size and inclination, and could reliably follow the trajectory of falling objects across different conditions. Finally, inter-specific differences were limited to the understanding of object properties, and suggest that domesticated species as goats might perform better than non-domesticated ones in tasks requiring these skills. These results provide new information on the cognitive skills of a still understudied taxon and confirm ungulates as a promising taxon for the comparative study of cognitive evolution.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4393574748"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Alina Schaffer, Anja Widdig, Ruben Holland, Federica Amici",Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology,Human-Animal Interaction Studies,University of Leipzig

Our results revealed that subjects were able to discriminate quantities when presented with two sets of food items that could differ in number, size and partially density. When presented with sets containing a different number of identical food items, subjects successfully selected the set with more items, with performance overall decreasing when sets had higher ratios (e.g., 1:3 vs 1:5). In addition, subjects could successfully maximize their food intake when both sets had the same number of items but items had different sizes. However, performance decreased at chance levels when varying both the number of items and their size or distribution. Giraffes performed better than other species in most conditions, and we found no evidence for an irrational bias toward sets with more, smaller items or denser distributions.

While there is extensive evidence of behavioral contagion in Haplorrhines (i.e. monkeys and apes), limited research exists in Strepsirrhines (i.e. lemurs). Here, we aimed to investigate the presence of contagious yawning and scratching in two captive groups of black-and-white ruffed lemurs (<italic>Varecia variegata</italic>) (N = 4) and red ruffed lemurs (<italic>Varecia rubra</italic>) (N = 4), and further test whether behavioral contagion is modulated by the model’s dominance rank. We conducted all occurrence sampling to examine whether individuals observing a yawning or scratching event (i.e. trigger event) were more likely to yawn or scratch in the following 2 minutes, as compared to individuals who did not observe it. We ran generalized linear mixed models and found that the likelihood of yawning and scratching was higher for individuals observing the trigger event than for individuals who did not observe the event, although the model’s dominance rank had no modulating effect on the probability of showing behavioral contagion. Our findings represent the first evidence of behavioral contagion in this genus and contribute to shed light on the distribution and the possible adaptive function of this phenomenon in primates.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4397001937"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","William Padilha Lemes, Federica Amici","University of Debrecen, Leipzig University",Primate Behavior and Ecology,University of Leipzig

The current study applies this model to nonhuman primates to investigate which forms of parenting humans share with other primates and how these interactions change over infants’ first year of life. We repeatedly observed 52 mother-infant pairs, including humans ( N = 11), chimpanzees and bonobos ( N = 21), and several species of small apes ( N = 20), during different daily activities when infants were 1, 6, and 12 months of age. Humans differed from apes in their higher probability of face-to-face contact and the use of object stimulation. Moreover, parenting seemed to be characterized by more variability within humans than within and possibly between ape species. Overall, the component model of parenting appears to be an effective tool to study the functional systems of parenting behavior in a comparative developmental perspective, by allowing direct comparisons between human and non-human primate species across development.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4398780883"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Katja Liebal, Manuela Ersson-Lembeck, Federica Amici, Martin Schultze, Manfred Holodynski","Freie Universität Berlin, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Goethe University Frankfurt, University of Münster, Leipzig University",Child and Animal Learning Development,University of Leipzig

So far, three studies have focused on ungulates, providing evidence that they may be susceptible to some optical illusions, in a way similar to humans. Here, we used two food-choice tasks to study susceptibility to the Müller-Lyer and Delboeuf illusions in 17 captive individuals belonging to four ungulate species ( Lama guanicoe, Lama glama , Ovis aries, Capra hircus ). At the group level, there was a significant preference for the longer/larger food over the shorter/smaller one in control trials. Additionally, the whole group significantly preferred the food stick between two inward arrowheads over an identical one between two outward arrowheads in experimental trials of the Müller-Lyer task, and also preferred the food on the smaller circle over an identical one on the larger circle in the experimental trials of the Delboeuf task. Group-level analyses further showed no significant differences across species, although at the individual level we found significant variation in performance. Our findings suggest that, in line with our predictions, ungulates are overall susceptible to the Müller-Lyer and the Delboeuf illusions, and indicate that the perceptual mechanisms underlying size estimation in artiodactyls might be similar to those of other species, including humans.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4398783226"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Caterina Berardo, Ruben Holland, Alina Schaffer, Álvaro L.

Carly A. Anderson,2018,Cortical correlates of speech intelligibility measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS),article,"Functional neuroimaging has identified that the temporal, frontal and parietal cortex support core aspects of speech processing. An objective measure of speech intelligibility based on cortical activation in these brain regions would be extremely useful to speech communication and hearing device applications. In the current study, we used noise-vocoded speech to examine cortical correlates of speech intelligibility in normally-hearing listeners using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive, neuroimaging technique that is fully-compatible with hearing devices, including cochlear implants. In twenty-three normally-hearing adults we measured (1) activation in superior temporal, inferior frontal and inferior parietal cortex bilaterally and (2) behavioural speech intelligibility. Listeners heard noise-vocoded sentences targeting five equally spaced levels of intelligibility between 0 and 100% correct. Activation in superior temporal regions increased linearly with intelligibility. This relationship appears to have been driven in part by changing acoustic properties across stimulation conditions, rather than solely by intelligibility per se. Superior temporal activation was also predictive of individual differences in intelligibility in a challenging listening condition. Beyond superior temporal cortex, we identified regions in which activation varied non-linearly with intelligibility. For example, in left inferior frontal cortex, activation peaked in response to heavily degraded, yet still somewhat intelligible, speech. Activation in this region was linearly related to response time on a simultaneous behavioural task, suggesting it may contribute to decision making. Our results indicate that fNIRS has the potential to provide an objective measure of speech intelligibility in normally-hearing listeners. Should these results be found to apply similarly in the case of individuals listening through a cochlear implant, fNIRS would demonstrate potential for a clinically useful measure not only of speech intelligibility, but also of listening effort.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W2892879472"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Rachael Lawrence, Ian M.

Carly A. Anderson,2019,Pre-operative Brain Imaging Using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Helps Predict Cochlear Implant Outcome in Deaf Adults,article,"Currently, it is not possible to accurately predict how well a deaf individual will be able to understand speech when hearing is (re)introduced via a cochlear implant. Differences in brain organisation following deafness are thought to contribute to variability in speech understanding with a cochlear implant and may offer unique insights that could help to more reliably predict outcomes. An emerging optical neuroimaging technique, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), was used to determine whether a pre-operative measure of brain activation could explain variability in cochlear implant (CI) outcomes and offer additional prognostic value above that provided by known clinical characteristics. Cross-modal activation to visual speech was measured in bilateral superior temporal cortex of pre- and post-lingually deaf adults before cochlear implantation. Behavioural measures of auditory speech understanding were obtained in the same individuals following 6 months of cochlear implant use. The results showed that stronger pre-operative cross-modal activation of auditory brain regions by visual speech was predictive of poorer auditory speech understanding after implantation. Further investigation suggested that this relationship may have been driven primarily by the inclusion of, and group differences between, pre- and post-lingually deaf individuals. Nonetheless, pre-operative cortical imaging provided additional prognostic value above that of influential clinical characteristics, including the age-at-onset and duration of auditory deprivation, suggesting that objectively assessing the physiological status of the brain using fNIRS imaging pre-operatively may support more accurate prediction of individual CI outcomes. Whilst activation of auditory brain regions by visual speech prior to implantation was related to the CI user's clinical history of deafness, activation to visual speech did not relate to the future ability of these brain regions to respond to auditory speech stimulation with a CI. Greater pre-operative activation of left superior temporal cortex by visual speech was associated with enhanced speechreading abilities, suggesting that visual speech processing may help to maintain left temporal lobe specialisation for language processing during periods of profound deafness.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W2955201346"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Carly A.

However, speech outcomes with a CI often lag behind those of normally-hearing children. Some authors have attributed these deficits to the takeover of the auditory temporal cortex by vision following deafness, which has prompted some clinicians to discourage the rehabilitation of pediatric CI recipients using visual speech. We studied this cross-modal activity in the temporal cortex, along with responses to auditory speech and non-speech stimuli, in experienced CI users and normally-hearing controls of school-age, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Strikingly, CI users displayed significantly greater cortical responses to visual speech, compared with controls. Importantly, in the same regions, the processing of auditory speech, compared with non-speech stimuli, did not significantly differ between the groups. This suggests that visual and auditory speech are processed synergistically in the temporal cortex of children with CIs, and they should be encouraged, rather than discouraged, to use visual speech.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W3049182983"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Faizah Mushtaq, Ian M.

Carly A. Anderson,2019,Evaluating time-reversed speech and signal-correlated noise as auditory baselines for isolating speech-specific processing using fNIRS,article,"Evidence using well-established imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrocorticography, suggest that speech-specific cortical responses can be functionally localised by contrasting speech responses with an auditory baseline stimulus, such as time-reversed (TR) speech or signal-correlated noise (SCN). Furthermore, these studies suggest that SCN is a more effective baseline than TR speech. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a relatively novel, optically-based imaging technique with features that make it ideal for investigating speech and language function in paediatric populations. However, it is not known which baseline is best at isolating speech activation when imaging using fNIRS. We presented normal speech, TR speech and SCN in an event-related format to 25 normally-hearing children aged 6-12 years. Brain activity was measured across frontal and temporal brain areas in both cerebral hemispheres whilst children passively listened to the auditory stimuli. In all three conditions, significant activation was observed bilaterally in channels targeting superior temporal regions when stimuli were contrasted against silence. Unlike previous findings in infants, we found no significant activation in the region of interest over superior temporal cortex in school-age children when normal speech was contrasted against either TR speech or SCN. Although no statistically significant lateralisation effects were observed in the region of interest, a left-sided channel targeting posterior temporal regions showed significant activity in response to normal speech only, and was investigated further. Significantly greater activation was observed in this left posterior channel compared to the corresponding channel on the right side under the normal speech vs SCN contrast only. Our findings suggest that neither TR speech nor SCN are suitable auditory baselines for functionally isolating speech-specific processing in an experimental set up involving fNIRS with 6-12 year old children.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W2959472121"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Faizah Mushtaq, Ian M.

An enhanced understanding of cortical correlates of poor speech perception in children would be highly valuable to oral communication applications, including hearing devices. We utilised vocoded speech stimuli to investigate brain responses to degraded speech in 29 normally hearing children aged 6–12 years. Intelligibility of the speech stimuli was altered in two ways by (i) reducing the number of spectral channels and (ii) reducing the amplitude modulation depth of the signal. A total of five different noise-vocoded conditions (with zero, partial or high intelligibility) were presented in an event-related format whilst participants underwent functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging. Participants completed a word recognition task during imaging, as well as a separate behavioural speech perception assessment. fNIRS recordings revealed statistically significant sensitivity to stimulus intelligibility across several brain regions. More intelligible stimuli elicited stronger responses in temporal regions, predominantly within the left hemisphere, while right inferior parietal regions showed an opposite, negative relationship. Although there was some evidence that partially intelligible stimuli elicited the strongest responses in the left inferior frontal cortex, a region previous studies have suggested is associated with effortful listening in adults, this effect did not reach statistical significance. These results further our understanding of cortical mechanisms underlying successful speech perception in children.

Anderson,2022,Cortical imbalance following delayed restoration of bilateral hearing in deaf adolescents,article,"Unilateral auditory deprivation in early childhood can lead to cortical strengthening of inputs from the stimulated side, yet the impact of this on bilateral processing when inputs are later restored beyond an early sensitive period is unknown. To address this, we conducted a longitudinal study with 13 bilaterally profoundly deaf adolescents who received unilateral access to sound via a cochlear implant (CI) in their right ear in early childhood before receiving bilateral access to sound a decade later via a second CI in their left ear. Auditory‐evoked cortical responses to unilateral and bilateral stimulation were measured repeatedly using electroencephalogram from 1 week to 14 months after activation of their second CI. Early cortical responses from the newly implanted ear and bilateral stimulation were atypically lateralized to the left ipsilateral auditory cortex. Duration of unilateral deafness predicted an unexpectedly stronger representation of inputs from the newly implanted, compared to the first implanted ear, in left auditory cortex. Significant initial reductions in responses were observed, yet a left‐hemisphere bias and unequal weighting of inputs favoring the long‐term deaf ear did not converge to a balanced state observed in the binaurally developed system. Bilateral response enhancement was significantly reduced in left auditory cortex suggesting deficits in ipsilateral response inhibition of new, dominant, inputs during bilateral processing. These findings paradoxically demonstrate the adaptive capacity of the adolescent auditory system beyond an early sensitive period for bilateral input, as well as restrictions on its potential to fully reverse cortical imbalances driven by long‐term unilateral deafness.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4223915109"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Carly A.

Hearing bilingual infants show increased visual attention to the mouth compared to monolingual infants. It is unclear how this altered visual attention to the face influences the processing of other crucial social cues, such as eye gaze. The goal of this online study was to determine how visual speech and participant’s prior language experience influences gaze following. Monolingual (n=20) and bilingual (n=22) hearing native English speakers (21.4 ± 2.7 yrs) were tested. The second language of bilingual participants encompassed a range of other languages. Participants performed a peripheral target discrimination task, preceded by cues to the target location that had equal probability of being valid or invalid. Cues were either arrow cues (a non-social control) or eye-gaze cues in a concurrently viewed static face. For these social gaze conditions, gaze shifts were accompanied by either: i) closed neutral mouth, ii) speech cues (linguistic mouth movements), or iii) non-speech cues (non-linguistic mouth movements). The magnitude of the gaze cueing effect was quantified as the difference between response times (RTs) on correctly performed valid and invalid trials. As a potential correlate, the lipreading ability of the subjects was assessed separately using an open-response, consonant-vowel-consonant word test. Across all conditions, bilinguals demonstrated a smaller gaze-cueing effect than monolinguals. In bilingual participants only, lipreading proficiency positively correlated with the gaze cueing effect when visual speech cues were also present, but not in non-speech conditions. Our results show that language experience can impact attentional orienting to facial cues. The effect in bilingual subjects may reflect enhanced division and shifting of attention between the eyes and the mouth when linguistic information is present in those participants who are more fluent lipreaders.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4311607408"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Nadia Gregoire-Mitha, Jason J.S.

The current literature suggests an immediate processing of presuppositions, starting directly on the word triggering the presupposition.

Experiment 1 replicates the immediate effects which were previously observed in a self-paced reading study. Experiment 2 then investigates whether this immediate processing of presuppositions is automatic or capacity-limited by employing the psychological refractory period approach and the locus of slack-logic, which have been successfully employed for this reason in various fields of cognitive psychology. The results argue against automatic processing, but rather suggest that the immediate processing of presuppositions is capacity-limited.

Nadine Bade,2022,Question-answer dynamics in deductive fallacies without language,preprint,"We introduce purely visual paradigms that convey the logical structure of illusory inferences from disjunction: (a AND b) OR c, a |- b. Although the logical information was conveyed entirely via non-linguistic means, we found that the visual paradigms induce reasoning fallacies, though less attractive than their linguistic counterparts. The visual paradigms highlight the role of alternative-based reasoning, or question-answer dynamics, as they control for narrowly interpretive processes that confound the study of their linguistic counterparts. To our knowledge, this is the first work to develop visual paradigms that represent reasoning fallacies committed by adults and involve multiple logical operators non-trivially embedded. Previous studies focused on pre-verbal children or non-human animals, and for this reason limited the scope of research to visually representing logically simple, valid inferences.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4280555093"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Woojin Chung, Nadine Bade, Sam Blanc-Cuenca, Salvador Mascarenhas","Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, University of Potsdam, Seoul National University, Université Paris Sciences et Lettres, Institut Jean Nicod, École des hautes études en sciences sociales",Child and Animal Learning Development,University of Potsdam
Nadine Bade,2021,On the scope and nature of<i>Maximise Presupposition</i>,article,"The paper introduces the principle Maximise Presupposition and its cognates. The main focus of the literature and this article is on the inferences that arise as a result of reasoning with Maximise Presupposition (‘anti‐presuppositions’). I will review the arguments put forward for distinguishing them from other inference types, most notably presuppositions and conversational implicatures. I will zoom in on three main issues regarding Maximise Presupposition and these inferences critically discussed in the literature: epistemic strength(ening), projection, and the role of alternatives. I will discuss more recent views which argue for either a uniform treatment of anti‐presuppositions and implicatures and/or a revision of the original principle in light of new data and developments in pragmatics.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W3167457164"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>",Nadine Bade,University of Potsdam,"Syntax, Semantics, Linguistic Variation",University of Potsdam
Nadine Bade,2021,New data on the competition between definites and indefinites,article,"In this paper, we report on four experiments investigating obligatory presupposition effects. Specifically, we look at the inferences arising from not using presupposition triggers when their use is supported by the context. We compare these inferences and the contextual factors for their derivation to presuppositions and implicatures. Extending previous work, we explore not only the English definite determiner ""the"" but also the dual ""both"" and their respective competition with the universal quantifiers ""every"" and ""all"".","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W3192880625"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Nadine Bade, Florian Schwarz","California University of Pennsylvania, Laboratoire de Géologie de l’École Normale Supérieure","Logic, programming, and type systems",University of Potsdam
Nadine Bade,2018,Obligatory Additives in the Antecedent of Conditionals,article,"The paper investigates the obligatory insertion of additive particles in the antecedent of conditionals. Two theories are compared with regard to their different predictions regarding this insertion. One theory works with the principle Maximize Presupposition (Heim, 1991), the other postulates a relation between mandatory exhaustivity inferences and insertion of additive particles (Bade, 2016). The first theory predicts additives to be obligatory under downward entailing (DE) operators which are holes for presuppositions. The second theory predicts the insertion of additives to not be obligatory under DE-operators due to the fact that exhaustivity inferences are usually blocked in these environments for independent reasons (Chierchia et al., 2012). Previous studies already suggest that additives (and iteratives) are not obligatory under negation, contrary to the predictions of Maximize Presupposition (Bade and Tiemann, 2016). In the present paper, an experimental study on the insertion of German “auch” in antecedent of conditionals is reported which tests the predictions of both theories and further confirms an account of obligatory additivity working with Obligatory Implicatures.","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W3118669542"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>",Nadine Bade,,"Syntax, Semantics, Linguistic Variation",University of Potsdam

Nadine Bade,2020,Foreword,book-chapter,"Center 833 ""The Construction of Meaning"" at the University of Tübingen.It is a book on language and a book on the poetry of Emily Dickinson, premised on the idea that expert knowledge about language will improve our understanding of literature, and studying literature will lead us to insights about language.It builds on a number of detailed analyses with the aim to inspire a more general interest in combining the methodologies employed by both disciplines.We hope that our book will be of interest to everyone who wants to broaden the evidential basis for linguistic investigation: we show that poetry is a fascinating source of linguistic phenomena that has often been overlooked by linguists though literary experts are at hand to explain their contexts and pragmatic meaning.We hope that our book will also be of interest to everyone who wants to learn about language as the basis of any meaning of literary texts: they will find precise explanations of phenomena that have often been overlooked or treated inadequately by literary scholars though linguistic experts are at hand to explain how they work.Although the group of authors is a large one, there are still others to whom we are grateful for ideas, expertise, and support: in the first place, we would","<a href=""https://openalex.org/W4213340881"" target=""_blank"">OpenAlex</a>","Matthias Bauer, Sigrid Beck, Saskia Brockmann, Susanne Riecker, Angelika Zirker, Nadine Bade",,Topic not available,University of Potsdam
