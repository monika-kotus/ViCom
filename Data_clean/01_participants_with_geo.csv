She is currently funded by a Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Research Fellowship and hosted by Professor Mairéad MacSweeney in the Visual Communication Research Group. She is a Visiting Researcher on Professor Stefan Schweinberger et al.’s ViCom project.

As a hearing child of congenitally deaf grandparents, and the daughter of a British Sign Language (BSL) Interpreter, BSL became her second language. She conducts her research through a diverse and inclusive lens informed by her experiences and the expert lived experiences of the Deaf community.

During her PhD she examined how the brain adapts after cochlear implantation in deaf adults. Importantly, she studied the neglected role of visual information and how this is combined with auditory information during social communication. Her current research focusses on how the brain coordinates visual information from the face and auditory information from the voice to support language and emotion perception. She is interested in how deafness and different language experiences, including accessing speech via a cochlear implant and bilingualism, can shape these processes. Her research has implications for optimising real-world language outcomes for people who are deaf and use a cochlear implant by taking a multimodal perspective of human communication and the brain."

In 2019, her interests broadened into the study of phenomena expressed within the visual modality, i.e. gesture. Such phenomena have been almost entirely overlooked in theoretical syntax and in Romance linguistics more generally. Her work in this area adopts a purely formal approach, drawing empirically from the gesture-rich languages of Southern Italy in particular.

After a bachelor’s degree in mathematical engineering and a master’s degree in information engineering from University of Tokyo, he obtained a PhD in linguistics and psychology from the University of Chicago. Immediately after his PhD, he laid a foundation for gesture research in Nijmegen; he established and led the “Gesture Project” at Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, in the Netherlands, from 1993 to 2003. Then, he held a faculty position at University of Bristol and University of Birmingham, before joining University of Warwick. He served as the President of the International Society of Gesture Studies and also as the Editor of the journal, GESTURE. His research primarily concerns the interplay among gesture, language and cognition.

He played a key role in establishing research on gesture as an important part of psycholinguistics. He has investigated how gesture relates to various aspects of language: motion events (Kita & Özyürek, 2003, Journal of Memory and Language), metaphor (Argyriou, Mohr & Kita, 2017, JEP: Learning, Memory and Cognition), and discourse contexts (Friz, Kita, Littlemore, & Krott, 2021, Journal of Memory and Language). He has also investigated how gesture varies cross-culturally (Kita, 2009, Language and Cognitive Processes), and how gesture production shapes gesturer’s conceptualization for speaking and thinking (Kita, Alibali, & Chu, 2017, Psychological Review).

He has also investigated the role of gesture in language development and spatial cognition. For example, he showed that deaf Nicaraguan children turned gesture into an emerging sign language (Senghas, Kita & Özyürek, 2004, Science) and that children learn a novel word better when they see an adult’s gesture depicting the word referent (Aussems & Kita, 2021, Child Development). He also showed that gesture production facilitates spatial cognition (Chu & Kita, 2011, JEP: General)."

She completed her BA and MA studies at the University of Ioannina, Greece and in her MA thesis she explored word order in GSL in simple declarative sentences and in wh-questions. In her PhD project, she investigates imperative speech acts in Greek Sign Language (GSL) and German Sign Language (DGS) by using elicitation and judgement tasks. Through her project she aims to discover which strategies -morphosyntactic and prosodic- are employed in sign languages for the articulation of imperative speech acts and define the contribution of particular manual and non-manual elements. One of her research goals is to find whether sign languages possess a particular sentence type for the expression of directive constructions, similar to the one we call “Imperative” in spoken languages, and how it can be defined by applying specific diagnostics."

He has taught at École Normale Supérieure, Paris, at the University of Southern California, at UCLA, and, since 2008, at NYU. P. Schlenker’s early interests included semantics, pragmatics, the philosophy of language and philosophical logic. He has conducted research on indexicals and indirect discourse, intensional semantics, anaphora, presuppositions, as well as semantic paradoxes. In recent work, he has advocated a program of ‘Super Semantics’ that seeks to expand the traditional frontiers of the field. He has investigated the semantics of sign languages, with special attention both to their logical structure and to the rich iconic means that interact with it. In order to have a point of comparison for these iconic phenomena, P. Schlenker has also investigated the logic and typology of gestures in spoken language. In collaborative work with primatologists and psycholinguists, he has laid the groundwork for a ‘primate semantics’ that seeks to apply the general methods of formal linguistics to primate vocalizations. And in recent research, he has advocated the development of a detailed semantics for music, albeit one that is very different from linguistic semantics."

After graduating in Biology at the University of Studies of Milan, she expanded her knowledge touching topics of evolutionary anthropology, linguistics and neurosciences with her MSc in Animal Behaviour at the University of Zurich – where she collaborated with Prof. Dr. Simon Townsend and his research group. Do humans and chimpanzees share communicative abilities? What are the cognitive mechanisms enabling communication? Which selective pressures lead to the evolution of language? These are some of the broader questions involved in her research. For her PhD in the Human Biology & Primate Cognition group lead by Prof. Dr. Katja Liebal at the University of Leipzig, she is currently probing chimpanzee multimodal signals for potential combinatorial structures. Given that combinatoriality is a core feature of human language, the investigation of comparable structures in other primate species is crucial to uncover the evolutionary origins of this trait."
