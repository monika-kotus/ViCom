# ViCom CollabMap

ViCom CollabMap is a data science project designed to visually present existing collaborations within the ViCom research group and uncover potential new connections. This project processes researcher data, extracts expertise, and generates potential collaborations, all presented in an interactive web-based map.

## Overview

This project was completed in a **3-week timeframe** and primarily focuses on data science and visualization, not web developmentâ€”so expect a few quirks here and there! It involves:

- Extracting publication data using **OpenAlex API**
- Using **OpenAIâ€™s API** to extract expertise from publication abstracts
- Calculating similarities between researchers based on shared keywords
- Deploying an interactive web app using **Streamlit** and **Folium**

## Data Collection Process

1. **Basic Data:**  
   Web scraping profiles of **75 researchers** from the ViCom website. This includes:
   - Name, role, project, affiliation, bio, and geolocation data.

2. **Publication Data:**  
   Extracted **1,264 publications** from the last **5 years** using **OpenAlex API**.  
   Data includes:
   - Title, abstract, year, authors, and source.

3. **Geolocation Data:**  
   Geolocation data was gathered for mapping researchers' locations.

## Project Workflow

1. **Extract Publication Data:**  
   Using `02.Extract_Publication_data.ipynb`, publication data is extracted from OpenAlex.

2. **Clean Publication Data:**  
   In `03.Clean_Publication_data.ipynb`, the extracted data is cleaned and preprocessed.

3. **Process Data with OpenAI:**  
   Expertise and themes are extracted using **OpenAI API** in `04. Data_processing_with_OpenAI.ipynb`.  
   This step helps generate keywords for each researcher.

4. **Clean OpenAI Data:**  
   The output from OpenAI is further refined in `05.Clean_OpenAI_data.ipynb`.

5. **Calculate Similarities:**  
   In `06.Similarity.ipynb`, similarities between researchers are calculated based on shared keywords/themes, resulting in approximately **3,000 potential collaborations**.

6. **Deploy the App:**  
   The main interactive web app is built using Streamlit in `app.py`.  
   It allows users to:
   - Explore existing collaborations
   - Discover potential collaborations based on shared synergies
   - View researcher profiles with expertise extracted from publications

## Files in the Repository

- **`02.Extract_Publication_data.ipynb`**: Extracts publication data from OpenAlex API.
- **`03.Clean_Publication_data.ipynb`**: Cleans and preprocesses the extracted publication data.
- **`04. Data_processing_with_OpenAI.ipynb`**: Uses OpenAI API to extract keywords and expertise for each researcher.
- **`05.Clean_OpenAI_data.ipynb`**: Cleans the data generated by OpenAI, ensuring accuracy.
- **`06.Similarity.ipynb`**: Computes synergies between researchers and identifies potential collaborations.
- **`app.py`**: The main Streamlit app that visualizes collaborations on an interactive map.

## How to Run the Project Locally

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9+
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd ViCom
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Add a `secrets.toml` File:**

   Create a `.streamlit` folder in the project directory and add a `secrets.toml` file with the following content:

   ```toml
   password = "your_password_here"
   ```

5. **Run the App:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

6. **Access the App:**  
   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to explore the ViCom CollabMap.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web-based interactive app.
- **Folium**: For generating interactive maps.
- **OpenAI API**: For extracting keywords and expertise from publication abstracts.
- **OpenAlex API**: For fetching publication data.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
